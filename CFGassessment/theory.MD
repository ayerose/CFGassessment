7. Looking at the following code, describe a case where this function
           would throw an error when called. Describe this case and talk about
           what exception handling you’ll need. 

   - **A TypeError will be raised when the input arguments are strings instead of numeric values for example. In order to catch and properly handle this error, it's essential to implement a  'TypeError' exception handling block.**
8. What is git branching? Explain how it is used in Git
   - **Git branching is an important feature that enables developers to create new development paths without affecting the primary codebase. 
   This is achieved by creating a pointer to a specific commit that represents a particular codebase state.
   This feature allows developers to experiment with new features or changes without affecting the main codebase 
   until they are ready to merge. This allows the switch between branches to be seamless
   and developers can create as many branches as needed. In order to create a new branch, developers can use the git branch command and they can switch between branches using 
   the git checkout command followed by the name of the branch.**
