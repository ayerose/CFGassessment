# Theory Questions

1. What does SDLC stand for?
- **software development lifecycle**

2. What exception is thrown when you divide a number by 0?
   - **"ZeroDivisionError: division by zero"**

3. What is the git command that moves code from the local repository
            to the remote repository? 

   - **git push**
4.  What does NULL represent in a database? 
- **A NULL value is a blank field with no value and displays the absence of the value**
5. Name 2 responsibilities of the Scrum Master 
   - **identifies and works to remove obstacles that impede the Scrum team from effectively implementing Scrum processes and practices.**
   
   - **Communicates the proper understanding of agile methodologies and its application as well as organizes scrum events such as Sprint Reviews, Sprint Planning Meetings, Daily Scrum Meetings/Stand Ups and Sprint Reviews**
6. Name 2 debugging methods, and when you would use them.
   - **1. Unit test in case I want to verify that my code works as expected and identify possible errors.** 
   - **2. Breakpoints in case I want to understand how my code is executing exactly and identify issues/errors that raises at specific points in my code.** 
7. Looking at the following code, describe a case where this function
           would throw an error when called. Describe this case and talk about
           what exception handling youâ€™ll need. 

   - **A TypeError will be raised when the input arguments are strings instead of numeric values for example. In order to catch and properly handle this error, it's essential to implement a  'TypeError' exception handling block.**
8. What is git branching? Explain how it is used in Git
   - **Git branching is an important feature that enables developers to create new development paths without affecting the primary codebase. 
   This is achieved by creating a pointer to a specific commit that represents a particular codebase state.
   This feature allows developers to experiment with new features or changes without affecting the main codebase 
   until they are ready to merge. This allows the switch between branches to be seamless
   and developers can create as many branches as needed. In order to create a new branch, developers can use the git branch command and they can switch between branches using 
   the git checkout command followed by the name of the branch.**
   



9. Design a restaurant ordering system. 
           
- Draw a list of key requirements:

  -   Menu display
  -  Order placement system that also allows the user to edit, modify and add requests.
    - Payment system (that accepts debit/credit card, google/apple pay, paypal, etc. -> Stripe for example).
    - Order tracking system to check the status of the user's order/delivery.
    -  Feedback system to rate the restaurant and delivery process.

- What are your main considerations and problems?
  - Enabling secure transactions and protecting user data.
  -  Ensuring that the system can handle high demand/value of orders.
    - Usability, User Experience and Accessibility.
  
- What components or tools would you potentially use? 
  - POS for order tracking and inventory management such as Adyen and Salesforce.
  - A third-party system for gift cards and loyalty programs such as Givex.
  - Customer feedback tool such as SurveyMonkey or Typeform.
  - Google Analytics for insights into the performance of the system's website and app.
